The information for the TSP will be found in a file in the following format. The first line of the file contains a number N indicating the total number of cities. After that are N lines, each containing N numbers. These numbers indicate the cost of traveling from city i to city j, where i is the row and j is the number in that row. You may assume that the city graph is completely connected (you can get from any city to any other city). Here is an example of what a file might look like:

5
0 3 1 4 2
4 0 6 1 4
1 2 0 6 5
6 3 1 0 8
4 1 9 3 0
